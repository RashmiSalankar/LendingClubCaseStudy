Grades/Sub-grades : Loans applications with grades G & F should be scrutinized more carefully.
Employment Length: Loans to customers with no employment history should be given considering their future prospects to repay.
Purpose: Background and financials of Small Businesses should be verified more stringently before approval
Debt-to-income ratio: A threshold should be established for debt-to-income ratio, above which loans should not be granted.
